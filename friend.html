        <h1 class="title">Let me tell you about my amazing friend!</h1>
        <p class="friend-description">
            I love my friends, and I know I suck at showing it, but let’s skip the formalities. This isn’t for everyone,
            but for one person, you.
            When ticking the box of those who misunderstand, you tick the highest, yet I still love you.
            You might think I’m a peace lover, lol, until you hear me talk. Or maybe, you’ll think I hate
            disrespect—because I do!
            If one tries nonsense, they get it back. As Dammy says in Yoruba, "mo man bo ko lo far," so it leads to
            disagreements, but gaslighters get what they deserve too.
            However, love obstructs because I don’t want to be on bad terms with my loved ones. My circle is small, and
            I don't want to lose any, except they lose me, fam.
        </p>
        <p class="friend-description">
            You’ll dish everything until I decide to dish it back, and then wahala go sup. You’re my best friend, yet
            you don’t believe I rate your presence.
            My friend who will say, “You can’t be telling me I am wrong,” but is my chief supervisor—my best friend that
            I don’t want to lose, even with all the toxicness.
        </p>
        <p class="friend-description">
            This might feel like a farewell, but actually, I’m just documenting the kind of friend I hold dear.
            You’re the friend it takes saying another friend's name for me to see care glow in your eyes.
            The one that can’t sleep out but will still worry about you when you do, lol. My friend, the best gift of
            2021
            with a touch of "I’m gonna frustrate you" vibe, lol.
        </p>
        <p class="friend-description">
            Yes, that's my friend. I made this to let you know that you mattered. The other friends weren’t
            overshadowing your importance.
            I take all you do because one disagreement might be okay for a lifetime, or two or more? Gan, no bad
            😊.
        </p>
        <p class="friend-description">
            Let it be on record that your insecurity and blind anger is ruining all we have.
            Now, my friend, just be in the oblivion you choose to stay in, but remember, I’m here even when you want to
            crawl out.
            Ma fo, we don’t burn bridges here.
        </p>
